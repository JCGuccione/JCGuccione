- 👋 Hi, I’m @JCGuccione
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world better with every interaction, step, and breath. This applies holistically; my fellow members of the human race, and the planet we call home and every living thing on it (without being a vegan or vegatarian).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...Cybersecurity, and I will test out for my CompTIA Sec+ within the next few weeks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that facilitates those 1 second gains and beyond.
- 📫 How to reach me Jonathan.Guccione@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am a 10 year veteran of the USMC Reconnaissance and Raider communities.
